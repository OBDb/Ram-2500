    description: "The fourth generation Ram 2500 Heavy Duty established the model as part of the standalone Ram brand after splitting from Dodge. Built on a stronger, fully boxed frame with hydroformed front frame rails, this generation offered significant capability improvements while focusing on comfort and refinement uncommon in the heavy-duty segment. Powertrain options included a 5.7L HEMI V8, 6.4L HEMI V8 (introduced in 2014), and the renowned 6.7L Cummins inline-six turbo diesel producing up to 800 lb-ft of torque in later years. Transmission options included six-speed automatics and six-speed manuals (for diesel models until 2018). Unlike the Ram 1500, the 2500 retained rear leaf springs, though with improved tuning for better ride quality. The interior shared much with the 1500, offering luxury features like heated and ventilated leather seats, premium audio systems, and the Uconnect infotainment system. Maximum towing capacity reached approximately 18,000 pounds for properly equipped models, while payload capacity approached 4,000 pounds. Available in regular cab, crew cab, and Mega Cab configurations with various bed lengths, the Ram 2500 offered configurations for work, family, and recreational use. The fourth generation received updates throughout its run, with notable refreshes in 2013 and 2016 introducing more modern styling, improved interiors, and enhanced capability."

    description: "The fifth generation Ram 2500 Heavy Duty debuted for the 2019 model year with a comprehensive redesign focusing on increased capability, improved technology, and enhanced comfort. Built on a redesigned frame utilizing 98.5% high-strength steel, the new generation offers significantly improved torsional rigidity and durability. Engine options include a standard 6.4L HEMI V8 producing 410 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and the optional 6.7L Cummins turbo diesel inline-six generating up to 370 horsepower and a class-leading 850 lb-ft of torque (later increased to 370 hp and 1,000 lb-ft), mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Maximum towing capacity exceeds 19,000 pounds with payload capacity approaching 4,500 pounds for properly equipped models. The interior represents a significant upgrade, mirroring many of the premium features from the Ram 1500 including the available 12-inch vertical touchscreen, active noise cancellation, and luxury appointments that rival many premium sedans. Available driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and a 360-degree camera system with trailer reverse guidance. The suspension was completely reengineered with frequency response damping shocks and progressive rear springs to improve both ride comfort and load-handling capability. Available in regular cab, crew cab, and Mega Cab configurations with various bed lengths and trim levels ranging from work-oriented Tradesman to ultra-luxury Limited, the fifth-generation Ram 2500 has been widely praised for bringing unprecedented refinement and technology to the heavy-duty pickup segment while maintaining the capability expected for serious work applications."
